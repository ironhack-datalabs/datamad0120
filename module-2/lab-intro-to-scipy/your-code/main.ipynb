The experiment was based on a claim by Muriel Bristol that she can taste whether tea or milk was first poured into the cup. Fisher devised this test to disprove her claim. The null hypothesis is that the treatments do not affect outcomes, while the alternative hypothesis is that the treatment does affect outcome.

We'll start by creating two derived columns in our dataframe. The first will contain 1 if the amount of money in `usd_pledged_real` is greater than the amount of money in `usd_goal_real`. We can compute this by using the `np.where` function. If the amount in one column is greater than the other, enter a value of 1, otherwise enter a value of zero. Add this column to the dataframe and name it `goal_met`."
