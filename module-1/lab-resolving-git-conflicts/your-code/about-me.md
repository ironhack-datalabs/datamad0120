Hello,

<<<<<<< HEAD
I am Patricia Carmona. I'm from Cordoba and I'm digital marketing analyst. Over last years I've been improving on my professional career as analyts working with SQL.

I decided to start at Ironhack because I need to learn more about data analysis. 

I would like to keep working as analyst for marketing and business.
