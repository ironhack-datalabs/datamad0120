# Bonus Questions:

# You will need to make some research on dictionary comprehension to solve the following questions

#21.  Write a function that asks for an integer and prints the square of it. 
# Hint: we need to continually keep checking until we get an integer.
# Use a while loop with a try,except, else block to account for incorrect inputs.




# 22. Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by any single digit besides 1 (2-9). 
# Use results as the name of the list 




# 23. Define a customised exception to handle not accepted values. 
# You have the following user inputs and the Num_of_sections can not be less than 2.
# Hint: Create a class derived from the pre-defined Exception class in Python
