    print(i**2)
  except Exception:
    print("It's not a number")

#Then use a finally block to print 'All Done.'
# Check in provided resources the type of error you may use. 

x = 5

#16. Handle the exception thrown by the code below by using try and except blocks. 
# Check in provided resources the type of error you may use.

#17. Handle at least two kind of different exceptions when dividing a couple of numbers provided by the user. 
# Hint: take a look on python input function. 
# Check in provided resources the type of error you may use. 




#18. Handle the exception thrown by the code below by using try and except blocks. 
# Check in provided resources the type of error you may use. 

f = open('testfile','r')

#20. The following function can only run on a Linux system. 
# The assert in this function will throw an exception if you call it on an operating system other than Linux. 
# Handle this exception using try and except blocks. 
# You will probably need to import sys

# Bonus Questions:

# You will need to make some research on dictionary comprehension to solve the following questions

#21.  Write a function that asks for an integer and prints the square of it. 
# Hint: we need to continually keep checking until we get an integer.
# Use a while loop with a try,except, else block to account for incorrect inputs.




# 22. Find all of the numbers from 1-1000 that are divisible by any single digit besides 1 (2-9). 
# Use results as the name of the list 




# 23. Define a customised exception to handle not accepted values. 
# You have the following user inputs and the Num_of_sections can not be less than 2.
# Hint: Create a class derived from the pre-defined Exception class in Python

Total_Marks = int(input("Enter Total Marks Scored: ")) 
Num_of_Sections = int(input("Enter Num of Sections: "))
